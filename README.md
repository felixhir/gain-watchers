# Gain Watchers

An application made for personal trainers to keep track of their clients plans on training.

## How to run?

1. Install dependencies using maven
2. Open the backend-directory in your favourite IDE and run the [GainWatchersApplication](./backend/0-plugin-layer/src/main/java/dhbw/GainWatchersApplication.java) (requires Java 8)
3. Open the [index-file](./frontend/index.html) in your favourite browser (only tested with Chrome). (Running a frontend is _that_ easy? Yes!)
