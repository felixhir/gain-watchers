# Gain Watchers

An application made for personal trainers to keep track of their clients plans on training.

## How to run?

1. Install dependencies using maven
2. Open the backend-directory in your favourite IDE and run the [GainWatchersApplication](./backend/0-plugin-layer/src/main/java/dhbw/GainWatchersApplication.java) (requires Java 8)
3. Open the [index-file](./frontend/index.html) in your favourite browser (only tested with Chrome). (Running a frontend is _that_ easy? Yes!)

## How to use?

The things you can do in the frontend are:
- See users, workouts and exercises (areas center to left)
- Create a user
- Create an exercise
- Create a workout
- Update a workout

To create anything use one of the first three forms to the right. To update a workout press "Edit" beneath the one you would like to make changes to. This will load the workout in the bottom-most form to the right. Once you have made your changes click "Update".
